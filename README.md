> Seam Components may be used in **any** web application as native **[âš¡Web Components âš¡](#with-native-web-components)**

## Description

> [See our official announcement!](https://www.seam.co/blog/Introducing-Seam-Components_ce7e8985-2fe6-4780-8c60-055b34daee55) ðŸŽ‰

Seam Components are a set of white-labeled UI elements that can be added to your application in seconds.
With these components, you can offer advanced device management features to your users without needing to develop complex logic for managing device state,
refreshing data, and performing actions.

## Installation

Add this as a dependency to your project using [npm] with

```
$ npm install @seamapi/react
```

[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/

## Usage

### With React

> Check out the [basic example app](./examples/basic)!

1. Obtain a publishable key from the [Seam Console].
2. Wrap your React app with the `SeamProvider`.
3. Drop in Seam Components.

```tsx
import { ConnectAccountButton, DeviceTable, SeamProvider } from '@seamapi/react'

export function App() {
  return (
    <SeamProvider publishableKey='your_publishable_key'>
      <main>
        <h1>My App</h1>
        <ConnectAccountButton />
        <DeviceTable />
      </main>
    </SeamProvider>
  )
}
```

[Seam Console]: https://console.seam.co/

### With Native Web Components

> Check out the [web component example app](./examples/web-components)!

1. Obtain a publishable key from the [Seam Console].
2. Add the `<script>` tag to your page and drop in Seam Components.

```html
<body>
  <seam-connect-account-button
    publishable-key="your_publishable_key"
  ></seam-connect-account-button>
  <seam-device-table publishable-key="your_publishable_key"></seam-device-table>
  <script
    type="module"
    src="https://react.seam.co/v/2.18.0/dist/elements.js"
  ></script>
</body>
```

> Update the version in the script tag above with the exact version of this package you would like to use.

#### Web component attributes and properties

Each React component is defined as a custom element:

- The element name is in in kebab-case,
  e.g., `<DeviceTable>` becomes `<seam-device-table>`.
- Each element is wrapped in a `<SeamProvider />`.
- An attribute and custom property is defined for each `<SeamProvider />` prop and component prop.
- Attributes are in kebab-case and properties are in snakeCase.

Attributes map directly to component props.
All attributes are passed as strings, thus non-string props have some limitations:

- Number props will be parsed using `parseFloat`.
- Boolean props should be passed as `true` or `false`, e.g., `disable-css-injection="true"` or `disable-css-injection="false"`.
- Array props may be passed as JSON, e.g., `device-ids="["foo", "bar"]"`,
  or CSV, e.g., `device-ids="foo,bar"`.
- Function and object props should not be passed as attributes.
  Set them as properties instead.

Use custom properties to work directly with JavaScript objects and primitives.

- This will avoid any issues with string parsing and serialization.
- Use the `onSessionUpdate` prop to maintain a reference to the internal Seam client.

For example,

```js
globalThis.customElements.whenDefined('seam-device-table').then(() => {
  const elements = globalThis.document.getElementsByTagName('seam-device-table')
  const element = elements[0]
  if (element == null) {
    throw new Error('Cannot find seam-device-table in document')
  }
  let seam
  element.onSessionUpdate = (client) => {
    seam = client
  }
  element.onDeviceClick = (deviceId) => {
    if (seam == null) return
    seam.devices.get({ device_id: deviceId }).then(console.log)
  }
})
```

[Seam Console]: https://console.seam.co/

### React Hooks

All components interact with the Seam API via a set of React Hooks.
You can use these hooks directly in your application to build your own components.

Import hooks directly from `@seamapi/react` or `@seamapi/react/hooks`.
For most applications, these imports are equivalent,
however if you are only using the hooks, we recommend importing from `@seamapi/react/hooks`
as it may enable performance or bundling improvements depending on your build system.

Hooks must be used inside the `SeamProvider`.
They are well-typed and follow a uniform API.

```tsx
import { SeamProvider, useDevices } from '@seamapi/react/hooks'

export function App() {
  return (
    <SeamProvider publishableKey='your_publishable_key'>
      <main>
        <h1>My App</h1>
        <Devices />
      </main>
    </SeamProvider>
  )
}

function Devices() {
  const { devices, isLoading, isError, error } = useDevices()

  if (isLoading) {
    return <p>Loading</p>
  }

  if (isError) {
    return <p>{error?.message}</p>
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h2>Devices</h2>
      <div>
        {devices?.map((device) => (
          <p key={device.device_id}>{device.properties.name}</p>
        ))}
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Styles

> CSS is automatically included unless using `<SeamProvider disableCssInjection />`.

Components are styled with plain Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
All styles are prefixed with `seam-` to avoid name collisions.

By default, the `SeamProvider` will inject a link tag into the document head to load the CSS.
If you prefer to manually load the CSS,
this behavior may be disabled with the `disableCssInjection` prop.
Then, either import the CSS using a supported bundler with

```tsx
import '@seamapi/react/index.css'
```

or place the following in the `<head>` tag:

> You must match the version string below with the exact version of this package used by your application.

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://react.seam.co/v/2.18.0/dist/index.min.css"
/>
```

#### Customizing Styles

> The `seam-` prefixed CSS class names are not part of the stable API and may change unexpectedly.

Each component accepts a `className` prop.
The class name will be set on the top level container, or if a sub-component is rendered, passed though.
This makes them compatible with native CSS and most CSS-in-JS systems, e.g., [Emotion] and [styled-components].

[Emotion]: https://emotion.sh/
[styled-components]: https://styled-components.com/

#### Using inside a modal dialog

A Seam Component must be a child of a DOM element with the `seam-components` class name
for the CSS styles to work properly.
Normally, all Seam Components are rendered as child of the `<SeamProvider />`
which ensures this condition.

React implementations of the modal dialog pattern often allow specifying
the contents of the modal as a child element, yet render the contents of the modal
in the DOM under a different parent element outside of the current branch of the DOM tree.
Thus, even when a Seam Component is logically rendered as a child of the `<SeamProvider />`
in the React tree, it will be rendered outside of that branch of tree in the actual DOM.

> This concern does not apply when using the Seam Components as web components.
> Each custom element already wraps the underlying component inside a container element with the correct class name.
> The lack of a default container element for each React component
> is an intentional decision to align with the standard React provider design pattern.

To handle this special case, use the `seamComponentsClassName` on the container that will
wrap the dialog content, e.g.,

```ts
import { useState } from "react"
import { Button, Dialog } from "@mui/material"
import { seamComponentsClassName, DeviceTable } from "@seam/react"

function DeviceTableInsideModal() {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)
  const handleOpen = () => {
    setOpen(true)
  }
  const handleClose = () => {
    setOpen(false)
  }
  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={handleOpen}>Open</Button>
      <Dialog
        className={seamComponentsClassName}
        open={open}
        onClose={handleClose}
      >
        <DeviceTable />
      </Dialog>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Fonts

> Fonts are automatically included unless using `<SeamProvider disableFontInjection />`.

The components are optimized for use with [Source Sans Pro], but will fallback to other system sans-serif fonts.

By default, the `SeamProvider` will inject a link tag into the document head to load the font.
If you prefer to manually provide the font,
this behavior may be disabled with the `disableFontInjection` prop.
Then, load it from Google Fonts by placing the following in the `<head>` tag:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Source+Sans+Pro:wght@400;600;700&display=swap"
/>
```

[Source Sans Pro]: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

#### Default CSP

When using the default provider settings, the components are compatible with this CSP:

```
default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' https://connect.getseam.com; img-src 'self' https://connect.getseam.com; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; style-src 'self' https://fonts.googleapis.com
```

#### Granular CSP

Depending on which assets you choose to host yourself, the CSP may be made stricter.

By self hosting the styles and recommended fonts (or choosing not to use them),
and proxying the Seam API endpoint, the components are compatible with this strict CSP:

```
default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' https://connect.getseam.com
```

The `img-src` is required as some components display device images from the Seam API.

When using the default endpoint, extend `connect-src` with

```
connect-src 'self' https://connect.getseam.com
```

When serving the fonts from Google Fonts, include `font-src` and `style-src` with

```
font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; style-src 'self' https://fonts.googleapis.com
```

When serving the CSS styles from the default CDN, extend `style-src` with

```
style-src https://react.seam.co
```

### Telemetry

By default, this library reports basic usage telemetry to the Seam API.
This may be completely disabled with `<SeamProvider disableTelemetry>`.

Before disabling telemetry, please consider the following:

- Telemetry is sent directly to the Seam API and is never sold to third parties.
- Telemetry is used by Seam for the sole purpose of improving Seam Components
  and directly enhancing the experience for your end users.
- No data is persisted on the client beyond the lifetime of the browser session: this library does not use cookies or local browser storage.
- Telemetry may be selectively disabled for some users to align with any existing data collection compliance requirements of your application.
- Telemetry does not negatively impact performance and adds minimal background network overhead.
- The implementation is small, simple to audit, and completely transparent: [src/lib/telemetry](src/lib/telemetry).

## Development and Testing

### Quickstart

```
$ git clone https://github.com/seamapi/react.git

### Requirements

You will need [Node.js] with [npm] and a [Node.js debugging] client.
Alternately, develop in the cloud with [Codespaces].

[codespaces]: https://github.com/features/codespaces

Be sure that all commands run under the correct Node version, e.g.,
if using [nvm], install the correct version with

```
$ nvm install
```

Set the active version for each shell session with

```
$ nvm use
```

Install the development dependencies with

```
$ npm install
```

[Node.js]: https://nodejs.org/
[Node.js debugging]: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/
[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/
[nvm]: https://github.com/creationix/nvm

### Storybook

Develop components with [Storybook].

Run the full storybook in development mode with

```
$ npm start
```

The deployed storybook runs in docs mode which does not contain the full storybook.
Develop the storybook in docs mode with

```
$ npm run docs:start
```

[Storybook]: https://storybook.js.org/

#### Chromatic

[Chromatic] automates visual and interaction tests for Storybook.

The full storybook for the main branch is hosted at
[storybook.react.seam.co](https://storybook.react.seam.co).

On each commit, the full storybook is published to Chromatic for review.
On pull requests, Chromatic will run UI regressions tests on each commit.
Chromatic reports results as status checks that link directly to the storybook.

If changes are detected, follow the link in the status checks to approve the changes.
_Contributors must be granted access to approve changes on Chromatic;
request access from another maintainer of this project._

##### Note on PR from forks

Pull requests from a public fork do not have access to the
Vercel secrets required to retrieve the preview deployment URL.
For these PRs, the Chromatic Storybook and Chromatic UI tests will run against the
fake version and fake seed from the main branch.

_If your PR is from a public fork and requires updates to the fake version or seed,
reach out to a project maintainer for assistance._

[Chromatic]: https://www.chromatic.com/

### Previews

Every pull request deploys the storybook in docs mode with the examples
in a [Vercel Preview Deployment]
where you may [comment directly on the preview][Vercel Comments].
This is the same storybook published on [react.seam.co](https://react.seam.co).

[Vercel Preview Deployment]: https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/preview-deployments
[Vercel Comments]: https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/comments

### Fake Seam Connect

This project uses a [fake version of Seam Connect](https://github.com/seamapi/fake-seam-connect)
to have deterministic responses for rendering views and running tests.

The tests use the [default seed](https://github.com/seamapi/fake-seam-connect/blob/main/src/lib/database/seed.ts).

Edit the Storybook seed data for the fake or find relevant ids for testing components here:
[Storybook fake seed](./.storybook/seed-fake.js).

### Fake Devicedb

Fake Seam Connect optionally depends on a [fake version of the Seam Devicedb](https://github.com/seamapi/fake-devicedb).
This is required by some components and hooks in this project.

The seed data for the fake is generated by pulling data from the real API.
Update this seed data with

```
$ npm run storybook:update-devicedb-seed
```

### Tests

Write tests with [Vitest].

[Vitest]: https://vitest.dev/

### Examples

Find fully working examples apps under `examples/`.
Each example app is built and deployed along with the Storybook documentation.

Run and develop the examples with,

```
$ npm run examples
```

### SVG Icon Components

The React components under `src/lib/icons` are generated from `assets/icons`.
To add a new icon:

1. Place or update the SVG icon in `assets/icons`.
2. Run `npm run generate`.
3. Import with

```tsx
import { SeamIcon } from 'lib/icons/SeamIcon.js'
```
